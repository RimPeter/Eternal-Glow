Deployment
Deploying Eternal Glow to a production environment involves several steps to ensure the application runs smoothly, securely, and efficiently. Below is a comprehensive guide to deploying the application, including setting up the database and configuring the server.

Preparing for Deployment
Choose a Hosting Provider

Select a reliable hosting provider that supports Django applications. Popular choices include:

Heroku
AWS (Amazon Web Services)
DigitalOcean
PythonAnywhere
Azure
Set Up a Production Environment

Create a Virtual Environment:

```bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install Dependencies:

```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Set DEBUG to False:

In your .env file, ensure that:

```dotenv
Copy code
DEBUG=False
```
Configure Allowed Hosts:

Add your domain or server IP to the ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py:

```python
Copy code
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com', 'www.yourdomain.com']
```
Setting Up the Database
For production, it's recommended to use a more robust database system like PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.

Install PostgreSQL

On Ubuntu:

```bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```
On macOS (using Homebrew):

```bash
Copy code
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```
Create a Database and User

```bash
Copy code
sudo -u postgres psql
```
Inside the PostgreSQL shell:

```sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE eternal_glow_db;
CREATE USER eternal_user WITH PASSWORD 'securepassword';
ALTER ROLE eternal_user SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE eternal_user SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE eternal_user SET timezone TO 'UTC';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE eternal_glow_db TO eternal_user;
\q
```
Configure DATABASE_URL

Update the .env file with the PostgreSQL database URL:

```dotenv
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=postgres://eternal_user:securepassword@localhost:5432/eternal_glow_db
```
Apply Migrations

```bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
```
Configuring the Server

Copy code
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
```
Follow the prompts to complete the SSL setup.
